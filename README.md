# Ayumi-new-programming-language
The basic use of any programming language is to process the information provided by the user and convert it into 1’s and 0’s which can be understood by the computer. In an ideal world there would be only one programming languages which could compute all the user requirement which would be quite impossible. Hence, A compiler/interpreter translates a program written in a high-level programming language into the low-level machine language that is required by computers as a study of An Analysis of Compiler/interpreter Design Come with the idea to develop a new programming language which Will be a user defined extension. there is a constant requirement for the development of newer/more efficient languages which could perform various operations at ease, with minimum requirements and simpler syntax and can be understood by majority of programmers.
